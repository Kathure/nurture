                        <p>Yes! Especially if you need to:

                            <ul>
                                <li>develop and maintain relationships</li>
                                <li>improve self-esteem and confidence</li>
                                <li>Improve self awareness</li>
                                <li>Develop emotional intelligence</li>
                                <li>manage stress levels</li>
                                <li>Handle upsetting emotions e.g. depression, anxiety, anger, etc</li>
                            </ul>

                            If any of the above is lacking, or you have other unmet emotional needs, counseling will improve your overall performance and enhance success in your life in general.</p>

                    <dt class="faq-item-name">Are soft skills the same as emotional intelligence?</dt>
                    <dd class="faq-item-text">

                        <p>Soft skills are ‘people-skills’ that help develop and maintain relationships.They exist in our emotional domain hence the term emotional intelligence (EQ). EQ is at the heart of engaging others and the wisdom to deal with people, while at the same time relating with ourselves.</p>

                    </dd>

                    <dt class="faq-item-name">How important is emotional competence?</dt>
                    <dd class="faq-item-text">
                        <p>Our school and college syllabi focus us on technical skills and intellect (IQ) and not on emotional intelligence (EQ) or people skills. We have too much college and too little kindergarten! </p>
                        <p>
                            We are brilliant in what we do technically, but we are so inept with interpersonal matters. We sometimes find it hard to take direction and personalize criticism especially if it comes from a junior. We are too busy with our part of the project we forget that we are one big team, with an aim at achieving organizational goals.
                        </p>

                    <dt class="faq-item-name">Is this a crisis line?</dt>
                    <dd class="faq-item-text">

                        <p>Though some persons who use our service are in crisis, majority are not. We do not consider ourselves a crisis line, but we can make necessary referrals if you need further help. Our services are not a replacement for long-term psychotherapy. We intend to work on hassles of everyday which if left unattended they accumulate can lead to hyper-stress or burnout. Our counselors have undergone training in accredited institutions and will engage you at your point of need.</p>
